# ADFS Credential Tester

Ever had a bunch of credentials during a pentest and wanted to check them in bulk against ADFS? Well, me too! This is why I made this script.
This script is a simple tool to validate the authenticity of credentials on Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS). It's designed to be easy to use and can save you a ton of time when testing a large number of credentials.

The script takes a file containing a list of username:password combinations as input. The file should be formatted with each username and password separated by a colon, with one credential per line (e.g. "user1:password1", "user2:password2", etc.).

et oui
